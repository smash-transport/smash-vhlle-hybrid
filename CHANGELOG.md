# Changelog


All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). This project does not adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), but it uses versioning inspired by it. Given a version number `X.Y.Z`,

* `X` is incremented for major changes in particular large backwards incompatible updates,
* `Y` is incremented for minor changes like an external pull-request that adds one feature and
* `Z` for the indication of a bug fix or other very small changes that are not backwards incompatible.

The major categories to group changes in this log are:

* `Input / Output` for all, in particular breaking, changes, fixes and additions to the in- and output files;
* `Added` for new features;
* `Changed` for changes in existing functionality;
* `Fixed` for any bug fixes;
* `Removed` for now removed features.

Also possible, but for this project less relevant, is `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
