# Configuration files

To properly configure all instances of the hybrid model, different
configuration files are necessary. This directory contains the necessary configuration files sorted by collision system and energy. The subdirectories are named as follows: `CollisionSystem_CollisionEnergy`, where the collision energy is provided as sqrt_s{NN}, unless stated differently.


###### Each subdirectory contains the following configuration files:
* SMASH configuration to provide initial conditions for vHLLE: `smash_initial_conditions.yaml`
* vHLLE configuration that uses output generated by SMASH: `vHLLE_hydro`
* SMASH configuration to set up afterburner after particlization: `smash_afterburner.yaml`
